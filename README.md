## Runing generateTrainingData firstly


if you want to test the code, first run the generateTrainingData function in helper.py which will generate training data in Numpy 
array format base on the dataset. 


## contents in gl_blstm.py
  3 models and 4 experiments are in gl_blstm.py
  full connect model(traditional Feed-Forward back Propagation ANN)
  BLSTM
  the novel model proposed in this study: GL-BLSTM
  

## dataset:
sequences are in resource/sequences file and according bonds assignment are in resource/bonds file.
