generateTrainingData is the first function you need call if you want to repeat my experiment
It only needs to call once.


if you want to test the code, first run the generateTrainingdata function in helper.py which will generate training data in Numpy 
array format base on the dataset. 


contents in GLBLSTM
  3 models and 4 experiments are in GLBLSTM.py
  ## full connect model(traditional Feed-Forward back Propagation ANN)
  ## BLSTM
  ##the novel model proposed in this study: GL-BLSTM
  

dataset:
sequence are in resource/sequences and according bonds assignment are in resource/bonds
